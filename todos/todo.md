# TODO Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-26

This is the active work queue.
`todos/security-review.md` tracks security finding validity and closure status.
Completed items are archived in `todos/completed-todo-history.md`.

## P0 CI + E2E Stability (Top Priority)
- [ ] CI-E2E-1 Resume point for next Codex session: start from `scripts/tests/run_dashboard_e2e.sh`, `scripts/tests/verify_playwright_launch.mjs`, `playwright.config.mjs`, `Makefile` (`test-dashboard-e2e`), and `e2e/run_dashboard_e2e.unit.test.js`; run `make dev` (terminal 1) plus `make test-dashboard-e2e` (terminal 2) and capture per-stage timings (unit, bundle budget, seed, preflight, Playwright) to prove there is no loop/stall; then run `DEBUG=pw:browser corepack pnpm exec node scripts/tests/verify_playwright_launch.mjs` to diagnose Chromium launch path and fix root cause so browser e2e runs without `PLAYWRIGHT_SANDBOX_ALLOW_SKIP`; finally, harden CI behavior so skip mode is never silently used in mandatory checks, retries are bounded and deterministic, and acceptance criteria are met: full `make test` completes in bounded time, Chromium e2e actually executes, and every failing step returns actionable diagnostics rather than hanging.

## P0 Launch-Readiness Performance Pass
- [ ] PERF-LAUNCH-1 Execute a final pre-launch performance and optimization pass (dashboard bundle-size budgets in strict mode, runtime latency/<abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>/memory envelopes, and high-cost request-path profiling), then lock release thresholds and acceptance criteria.

## P1 Privacy and Data-Protection Follow-up
- [ ] SEC-GDPR-2 Enforce deterministic cleanup/expiry for stale fingerprint state keys (`fp:state:*`, `fp:flow:*`, `fp:flow:last_bucket:*`) aligned to configured fingerprint TTL/window controls.
- [ ] SEC-GDPR-3 Add an optional event-log IP minimization mode (raw vs masked/pseudonymized) for privacy-sensitive deployments, with explicit tradeoff documentation.
- [ ] SEC-GDPR-4 Add a deployer-ready privacy/cookie disclosure template in docs (lawful basis, retention table, storage inventory, and rights-handling workflow).

## P0 Deployment Path Excellence (Single-Host + Akamai/Fermyon)
Reference plan: [`docs/plans/2026-02-20-deployment-paths-and-adversarial-simulation-plan.md`](../docs/plans/2026-02-20-deployment-paths-and-adversarial-simulation-plan.md)

- [ ] DEP-ENT-1 Implement strict enterprise distributed ban-sync mode for authoritative multi-instance posture (no silent local-only divergence path).
- [ ] DEP-ENT-2 Add ban-sync observability (<abbr title="Service Level Objective">SLO</abbr> metrics for sync result and lag) to support promotion/rollback decisions.
- [ ] DEP-ENT-3 Add two-instance Spin integration coverage with shared Redis to prove ban/unban convergence behavior.
- [ ] DEP-ENT-4 Add outage/partition tests for distributed state (Redis unavailable/degraded) and assert explicit configured behavior by mode.
- [ ] DEP-ENT-5 Add deploy/runtime guardrails that validate enterprise distributed-state posture against outbound and backend requirements before authoritative operation.
- [ ] DEP-ENT-6 Design optional asynchronous mirror of high-confidence bans to Akamai Network Lists (additive perimeter control; Shuma policy remains source-of-truth).

## P1 Dashboard IA: Promote Rate Limiting and GEO to Top-Level Tabs
- [ ] DSH-RG-1 Define dashboard information architecture update and tab order for new top-level `Rate Limiting` and `GEO` tabs (including hash-route mapping and back/forward behavior).
- [ ] DSH-RG-2 Move Rate Limiting controls from Config into a dedicated top-level `Rate Limiting` tab while preserving existing design language, save behavior, and validation rules.
- [ ] DSH-RG-3 Move GEO controls from Config into a dedicated top-level `GEO` tab while preserving existing design language, save behavior, and validation rules.
- [ ] DSH-RG-4 Keep config persistence and dirty-state semantics correct after the split (cross-tab unsaved summary, invalid-field tracking, and section-local warnings).
- [ ] DSH-RG-5 Update status/monitoring cross-navigation so operators can jump directly into the new `Rate Limiting` and `GEO` tabs for tuning.
- [ ] DSH-RG-6 Add/refresh dashboard unit + e2e coverage for tab routing, control enablement/disablement, save flows, and regression of existing config payload shape.
- [ ] DSH-RG-7 Update operator docs and screenshots so tab layout and control locations match the shipped dashboard.

## P1 Akamai Integration Controls Expansion (Rate Limiting + GEO)
- [ ] AK-RG-1 Write a concise architecture note (or ADR if scope broadens) that defines exact semantics for Akamai controls on Rate Limiting and GEO (`off`, `additive`, `authoritative` behavior, precedence, fallback, and trust boundaries).
- [ ] AK-RG-2 Define config surface and naming for Rate/GEO Akamai integration controls, including defaults and whether each is a simple toggle or toggle+mode control.
- [ ] AK-RG-3 Implement admin API + runtime config validation for the new Rate/GEO Akamai controls with explicit guardrails and clear validation errors.
- [ ] AK-RG-4 Implement runtime behavior wiring so Akamai Rate/GEO signals can influence decisions according to the defined mode semantics without bypassing Shuma’s policy ownership.
- [ ] AK-RG-5 Add dashboard controls and help text for Rate/GEO Akamai integration in the new top-level tabs, including disabled-state behavior and operator warnings.
- [ ] AK-RG-6 Add observability and policy-event taxonomy coverage for Rate/GEO Akamai decisions (source, mode, action, fallback reason, and downgrade behavior).
- [ ] AK-RG-7 Add integration/e2e tests for mode precedence, downgrade/fallback safety, and regression against internal-only behavior.
- [ ] AK-RG-8 Document rollout/rollback guidance for enabling Rate/GEO Akamai integration in enterprise deployments, including promotion gates and emergency disable steps.

## P1 Research Dossiers (Paper-by-Paper TODOs)

#### Tarpit Asymmetry Hardening (`work-gated`, `token-chained`, `egress-budgeted`)

Architecture alignment reference: [`docs/plans/2026-02-23-maze-tarpit-architecture-alignment-plan.md`](../docs/plans/2026-02-23-maze-tarpit-architecture-alignment-plan.md)

- [ ] TAH-12 Add dashboard/admin visibility for the new tarpit progression + egress metrics and operator guidance for safe tuning (recommended starting ranges and rollback thresholds).
- [ ] TAH-19 Before launch, tighten collateral-risk controls (especially bucket-based persistence escalation), then re-evaluate tarpit defaults.

Execution order for remaining tarpit work:
1. `TAH-11`
2. `TAH-12`

## P1 Distributed State and Limiter Correctness
- [ ] (Enterprise/hybrid track; non-blocking for `self_hosted_minimal`) Close distributed-state correctness remaining risks from `DEP-ENT-*` tasks and promote enterprise authoritative posture only after convergence <abbr title="Service Level Objective">SLO</abbr> evidence is stable.

### P1 Outbound Capability and External Provider Constraints
- [ ] OUT-4 Create an ADR for non-Redis external integrations (for example webhook notifications or cross-service sync) that defines the approved pattern in Spin (`allowed_outbound_hosts` expansion vs sidecar/bridge service).


### Stage 2.6 follow-up: Maze test coverage closure
- [ ] MZ-T1 Add Spin integration coverage for live opaque maze traversal across multiple hops: entry -> tokenized link follow -> checkpoint submit -> `<maze_path_prefix>issue-links` progression -> fallback/escalation branches, with assertions for deterministic fallback action/reason semantics.
- [ ] MZ-T2 Add browser E2E coverage for live maze behavior (not just dashboard config): JS-enabled and JS-disabled cohorts, checkpoint/micro-PoW flow, replay rejection, and high-confidence escalation outcomes under real HTTP/session behavior.
- [ ] MZ-T3 Add concurrency/soak coverage for maze state/budget primitives (replay keys, checkpoint keys, global/per-bucket budget caps) to detect contention/regression under burst traversal and verify bounded host-write behavior.
- [ ] MZ-T4 Wire the new maze integration + E2E + soak tests into canonical Makefile/CI verification paths (`make test`, focused rerun targets, and CI failure gates) so maze behavior regressions fail fast before merge.

## P2 Challenge Roadmap
- [ ] NAB-12 Evaluate optional PAT-style private attestation signal ingestion as additive evidence only (non-blocking).
- [ ] NAB-13 Execute short Not-a-Bot hardening sprint per [`docs/plans/2026-02-21-not-a-bot-hardening-sprint.md`](../docs/plans/2026-02-21-not-a-bot-hardening-sprint.md) (unknown-modality cap, stronger pass corroboration, cross-attempt/session consistency gating, accessibility-safe anti-fast-path tightening).

## P2 GEO Defence Maturity
- [ ] Add ASN/network dimensions in GEO policy logic (not just country list). (`src/signals/geo/mod.rs`, `src/config/mod.rs`, `src/admin/api.rs`)
- [ ] Add GEO/ASN observability and alerting (metrics, dashboard panels, docs). (`src/observability/metrics.rs`, dashboard, docs)

## P2 Modularization and Future Repository Boundaries
- [ ] Write objective criteria for future repo splits (API stability, release cadence, ownership, operational coupling).
## P3 Platform and Configuration Clarity
- [ ] Design runtime-agnostic architecture that keeps core detection logic portable while preserving Fermyon-first performance paths.
- [ ] Evaluate renaming `SHUMA_CHALLENGE_PUZZLE_RISK_THRESHOLD` to `SHUMA_BOTNESS_CHALLENGE_PUZZLE_THRESHOLD` to reflect botness semantics.
- [ ] Standardize terminology across code/UI/docs so `honeypot` and `maze` are used consistently instead of interchangeably.
- [ ] Document setup-time config bootstrapping clearly: how `make setup` creates/populates local env, how env-only vars are sourced, and how KV defaults are seeded and later overridden.
- [ ] Long-term option: integrate upstream identity/proxy auth (OIDC/SAML) for dashboard/admin instead of app-level key login.
